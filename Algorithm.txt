Game of Life Algorithm

1.	Declare the Grid boundaries
2.	Set up the initial values for the Grid
3.	Display the Grid with values
4.	Apply the game rules to every cell
5.	Loop through every cell
6.	Check the neighbours, if they are alive
7.	If(cell alive , <2 or >3 neighbours) then cell dies
8.	If(cell = 2 or 3 neighbours) then cell stays
9.	If(cell has 3 neighbours) then it re-borns
10.	Display new Grid


Plan to do in C#

1.	Create a game board whth random values/user input
2.	Assign boolean value to each cell
3.	Depending on true or false, fill each cell with a specific character for true else blank
4.	Take cursor to the beginning of the board and apply game rules
5.	Check for the Live Neighbours 
6. 	Show the simulation
